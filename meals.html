        <h3>chicken shawarma</h3> 
        <p>
            This Chicken Shawarma recipe is going to knock your socks off! Just a handful of every day spices makes an incredible Chicken Shawarma marinade that infuses the chicken with exotic Middle Eastern flavours. 
            The smell when this is cooking is insane!

        <h3>
            What is Chicken Shawarma, actually??
        </h3>
        <p>
            Shawarma is a popular dish originating from the Middle East. It's a popular street food that is traditionally made in the form of spiced meats that are stacked on a vertical rotisserie with thin slices shaved off as it rotates. But don't worry! We can cook our horizontally in a good old pan or on the BBQ!
        </p>

        <p>
            Shawarma was traditionally made with lamb, mutton and chicken though these days you see it with beef too. It’s commonly served in the form of a wrap, though in some countries you see it served on plates with sides such as seasoned rice or fries, and salads. In this recipe, I'm giving you both options!

        <h3>
            Ingredients in Chicken Shawarma
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken</li>
                <p>I like to make Shawarma with boneless, skinless thighs as its juicier than breast. But chicken breast and tenderloin both work great.</p>

            <li>Lemon juice - Fresh!</li>

            <li>Olive oil</li> <p>- For a touch of flavour but also to dilute the lemon juice so it doesn't “cook” the chicken (like we intentionally do with ceviche!).</p>

            <li>Spices</li><p> - Nothing out of the ordinary here! The only one you might not have in stock is cardamom, though these days its easily found at any grocery store. It has a piney, sort of citrusy flavour and it is a key ingredient that distinguishes the Shawarma marinade from other cuisines, such as Mexican, that regularly uses the other spices used in this recipe. In short, don't skip it!</p>
        </ul>

            Shawarma is traditionally served with either a tahini sauce or a Yogurt Sauce.

            How to make Chicken Shawarma?
        </h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                For the best results, it's best to marinate the chicken overnight. But to be honest, the volume and flavour of the marinade is intense enough that you can get away with a minimum of 3 hours of marinating. Been there, done that plenty of times, and nobody has complained!
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix marinade - For convenience, just mix the marinade directly in a ziplock bag. A bag works best because the chicken remains nicely coated in the marinade. If you prefer to use a container, either turn the chicken a few times or increase the marinade by 50%.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add chicken into the marinade. Seal the bag, removing excess air, then massage to coat from the outside. Leave to marinade for 12 to 24 hours in the fridge. If you're pressed for time, even 3 hours will do!
            </li>
            <li>
                Yogurt sauce - Make the yogurt sauce simply by mixing the ingredients then set aside for at least 20 minutes to let the flavours meld. This will keep for 3 days in the fridge.
            </li>

            <li>
                Cook chicken either on the stove or on the BBQ. It will get a great crust on it from the spices, and you will adore the smell. It's intoxicating!
            </li>

            <li>
                Rest chicken for at least 3 minutes before serving to allow the juices to redistribute throughout the flesh, else they will just run out everywhere when you slice the meat.
            </li>

            <li>
                To serve, just pile everything on a platter and let everybody make their own wraps! The chicken, lettuce, tomato slices, onion, yogurt sauce and warmed flatbreads – homemade or store bought. If the chicken is on the larger side, I sometimes slice it. But if they are smaller, I tend to just leave them whole.
